# Computational-Physics-UG

Here I have uploaded sample codes in python on numerical methods in physics learned over the years in UG level coursework.

This consists of Introductory Codes in Python which is sufficient to get into the idea of the programming language and caters the foundational knowledge required to use Python in Computational Physics purposes.

In the 2nd part, several topics on introductory numerical methods, plotting, visualization and their applications in few physics problems has been introduced that suffice as the backbone tool for more advanced level computational purpose in physics.
